Porsche unveiled its first electric car, called the Taycan, on Wednesday.
The car was introduced in two high-performance versions, the 670 horsepower Taycan Turbo and the 751 horsepower Taycan Turbo S.
The "Turbo" in the name might be a little confusing.
These cars have no actual turbochargers because they're powered entirely by electricity.
Turbochargers are used to boost the power output of gasoline engines.
